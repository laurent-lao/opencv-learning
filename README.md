# Learning-OpenCV
As a member of the UAV Concordia club, I had to learn OpenCV for Python 3

## ImageThresholding.py
This script uses much of the code in the tutorial documentation of OpenCV available [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_thresholding/py_thresholding.html#thresholding) for image thresholding. It features launching the python script with a file argument and the type of thresholding (simple or adaptive). Then, there is a menu to edit the various values to compare and learn what each value does.

## HarrisCornerDetection.py
This script uses much of the code in the tutorial documentation of OpenCV available [here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_features_harris/py_features_harris.html#harris-corners). It features launching the python script with a file argument and a menu to change the values to learn what each variable does.

### Requirements
These python scripts have these following dependencies:
- Python 3
- OpenCV2
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
